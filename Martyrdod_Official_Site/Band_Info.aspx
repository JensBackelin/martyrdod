        Swedish crustpunk horde Martyrdöd are among the newest crop of heavy, brutal, 
            metallic crust-influenced bands to join the Southern Lord cult. In a scene overabundant 
            with clones of the founding/front running acts of the genre, Martyrdöd manage to remain 
            heavily unique in their filth-ridden approach. While undeniably influenced by acts like 
            Anticimex, Bathory, and Totalitär, the band intertwines their crust roots with sinister, 
            haunting soundscapes and unique blackened riff attacks.<br />
        <br />
        "Elddop" was recorded at the infamous Studio Fredman (At The Gates, Amon Amarth, Opeth) 
            by Fredrik Nordström! The riffs are raw and powerful, with haunting melodies colliding 
            with a storm of raw sonic shrapnel. Both Martyrdöd guitarists are veterans of the Swedish 
            metal scene also playing in: Skitsystem, Agrimonia, Miasmal etc.
